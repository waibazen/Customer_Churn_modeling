# Customer_Churn_modeling
Understanding why and what kind of Customers are most likely to leave can lead to actions to improve Customer retention as well as possibly planning new campaigns in advance to increase retention.
Goal of this project: understand the key drivers of churn happening within the company and build a model that can predict customer churn.
1. Created a tool that predicts the likelihood of employee churn (accuracy:86%) and identified key features of churn to help management in making strategic changes to improve retention 

2. Engineered and analysed dataset feature columns and applied transformation to categorical fields

3. Used different Sampling techniques to optimize model like:-oversampling and SMOTE

4. Optimized Logistic and Random Forest Regressors  to reach the best model

5. Utilized Random Forest's Feature Importance to identify key feature importances for the prediction model
